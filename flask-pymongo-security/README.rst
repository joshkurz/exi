Flask-PyMongo-Security
======================

This code is an initial effort to fork Flask-Security to accomodate PyMongo which adds security features to a Flask application.

I hope to move tests from exi/tests/security to flask-pymongo-security/tests.

If anyone would like to participate, please contact me via Skype at larryeitel. Thank You.
